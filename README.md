## Overview  
This project demonstrates my understanding of NumPy, a fundamental library for numerical and matrix-based computation in Python.  
It covers array creation, manipulation, statistical analysis, broadcasting, and vectorization, all core skills in data science and machine learning.

## Project Sections

### **1. Array Creation & Manipulation**
- Creating arrays using `np.array`, `np.arange`, and `np.linspace`
- Reshaping arrays with `.reshape()`  
- Indexing and slicing arrays efficiently

### **2. Statistics with NumPy**
- Calculating mean, median, variance, and standard deviation  
- Generating data with `np.random.normal`  
- Computing correlation matrices using `np.corrcoef`

### **3. Broadcasting & Vectorization**
- Performing operations between arrays of different shapes  
- Applying mathematical operations (like `np.square`, `np.sqrt`) without loops  
- Understanding how NumPy automatically handles dimensions
